- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m @LuckyHimeko
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux Debian, Python, Supercomputers and Hardware.
- Terminals are fun. My computer is my best friend (until he starts yelling about Windows stuff...)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Java, I'm a newbie dev!
- I love sleeping and gaming. When I am not working I am either doing one of those two :P! The LuckyHimeko duality is like the wave-particle duality :P
