- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, Iâ€™m @LuckyHimeko
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux, more specifically Debian and Ubuntu, Python, WSL, Supercomputers and Hardware.
- Terminals are fun. My computer is my best friend (until he starts yelling about Windows stuff...)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Java, I'm a newbie dev!
- I love sleeping and gaming. When I am not working I am either doing one of those two :P!
- I am a Chemical Engineer by nature, but made a career change in IT.
